A GUIDE FOR THE 
STUDY OF ANIMALS 


PREFACE 


The following guide to the study of animals is intended for pupils in 
secondary schools It was prepared by the authors at the request of 
the Biology Round Table an association composed of the teachers of 
Biology in the Chicago High Schools to whom the authors wish to take 
this opportunity of expressing their appreciation of the many helpful 
suggestions and criticisms of the manuscript 

The time has passed when a high school course in zoology consists 
simply of a somewhat simplified edition of a similar course in 
college All teachers now recognize that the motivation of any 
course should be its adaptability to the needs of the student and 
that zoology must be taught from the standpoint of the student rather 
than that of the subject In preparing this guide the authors have 
tried to keep these points in mind 

The matter of presentation the order of topics and the choice of 
material has been much discussed but the trend of opinion has 
finally set in toward an ecological rather than a type study of 
animals that there should be in the case of young students a brief 
study of rather a large number of animals to bring out some general 
biological law rather than an exhaustive study of a very few types 
It is further recognized that the use of a reference library is 
essential in connection with and to supplement the 
laboratory work as there are some topics beyond the ability of the 
young student for original investigation as well as impossible in 
the amount of time usually allotted to the subject in our crowded 
curricula Of great importance is the economic side of zoology 
especially its bearing upon the applied sciences of medicine 
sanitation household science and agriculture and this phase has 
received special attention in this guide 

The desirability of field work has always been recognized but the 
special conditions under which schools must work are so variable as 
to make any set directions for field work of little value and so 
they have in most cases been omitted in this work Each teacher can 
easily give such special direction for collecting material and study 
in the field as the locality of the school and the time available for 
it shall determine 

Since zoology will probably be the pupil s first laboratory science 
the authors have preceded the more formal portion of the manual with 
a series of short exercises on familiar and easily obtained animals 
in order to introduce the pupil to the laboratory method and to 
stimulate his interest training him at the outset to be constantly 
on the outlook for specimens and to show him how much may be learned 
from common things right around him if he will only use his eyes We 
have also begun the more formal portion of the guide with insects 
since in the fall they are easily collected and may be studied alive 
They illustrate moreover the principles of classification and 
method of using keys and other means of finding out the names of 
animals This would seem to be pedagogically sound for some recent 
experiments with pupils show that the first question that comes into 
a child s mind upon seeing a new or strange specimen is What is it 

A larger portion of the guide is given to the chordates than is 
usually the case The authors also believe that this is correct and 
in accord with the natural interest of the pupil It will serve to 
connect his zoology more closely with his daily experiences 

There is material enough provided to allow the teacher a chance to 
select that best adapted to his purposes or conditions as well as to 
provide for those schools that give more than one year to zoology 



CHAPTER I 

INTRODUCTORY STUDIES OF LIVING ANIMALS 


In the following brief exercises the primary purpose is to arouse an 
active attentive interest on the part of the pupil in various forms 
of animal life which may be at hand reminding him of what and how 
various creatures eat how they breathe how they get ideas of the 
world how they get about and perhaps how they succeed where others 
fail Of secondary importance is the introduction of laboratory 
methods by easy stages The pupil should feel that his natural 
curiosity is only being directed to definite ends and that he is free 
to investigate in his own way 

The types here given are only a few of the many to be found in the 
early fall and these exercises in several cases may be used for 
other forms than those definitely mentioned There should be a great 
deal of promiscuous collecting by the class and in the mass of 
material gathered the following types will probably be fairly 
abundant 


THE LIVING FLY 


Living flies in cages and individual specimens in small wide mouth 
vials with cotton stoppers for the admission of air Sugar crystals 
may be used for feeding Simple lenses 


Notice the division of the body into three regions head thorax and 
abdomen The six legs the large wings and the small feelers may be 
easily found as are the large eyes the extensible mouth and 
beneath the larger wings the small undeveloped ones looking like tiny 
knobs 

State the general color of your specimen and give any special 
markings on its body 

Is the body smooth or has it a covering of any kind Do you regard 
the fly as a cleanly animal Why 

Under what conditions do the fly use its legs Its wings What 
enables it to walk upside down What use can you assign to the small 
wings 

Judging by the relative size of the feelers and the eyes do you 
think the fly relies more upon its sight or its feeling Since the 
eyes can probably see you any place where you see them determine 
through how much of a circle the fly can see 

How does the fly eat Does it eat solid or liquid food 

Where is the extensible mouth proboscis kept when not in use 
What is the fly doing when washing its face 

From your own observation in the barn and the alley what do you 
know about the fly s cleanliness in choosing its food How would it 
affect articles in the pantry 

From the foregoing statements show how flies may be a serious 
factor in dealing with disease 

What means may be employed as protection against adult flies 
Against their breeding places and maggots 


a The entire fly seen from above 


THE LIVING MAGGOT 

Living specimens in pans or cotton stoppered bottles with some food 
material and moist cloth or paper lenses 


Notice the general worm like form of the maggot or grub the plain 
and uniform color and the absence of all elaborate structures as 
wings and feelers 

Since this creature is destined to become a flying or walking 
insect what organs will have to appear Is there any indication of 
these structures at present 

Give the color of the specimen and explain how the presence or 
absence of strong light seems to have affected the color Is this 
effect usual in animals or plants that you know 

Tell how the animal gets from place to place describing any 
special structures you find which aid in this work 

How can you tell the head end Tell how the amount of work that 
the mouth and mouth parts do affects their size and indirectly that 
of the region where they are 

What senses and sense organs has the maggot Test any of these 
senses or organs gently by any means at your disposal or recall any 
experience you have had along this line Which senses or organs seem 
to be best developed 

Explain briefly how the active or sluggish habits either 
determine or are determined by the condition of the senses or 
sense organs 

Since Mother Nature seems to want maggots to develop 
rapidly tell how she economizes in energy and material when 
forming them 

Show how the development of maggots in refuse matter is 
actually beneficial 

From the standpoint of flies and human welfare show why 
maggots should not be allowed to live stating how they may be 
prevented 

Look up the story of the pupa of the house fly the 
development and work of the bot fly of the ox warble of the 
tsetse fly 


THE LIVING COCKROACH 


Individual specimens in cages jars or wide mouth vials with cotton 
stoppers to admit air Several roaches in large cages with material 
for food and concealment 


What is the general color and the average size of cockroaches 

During what time of the day are roaches most active Where do they 
hide at other times How do their shape and color aid concealment 
Note any odd or striking colors or marks which might make them 
distinguishable to their mates 

Is the roach a quick or a slow moving animal How does it get 
about by running jumping walking crawling swimming or flying 
Turn your specimen on its back and see how it recovers its proper 
position Notice the relative size and development of the wings and 
their use in flying 

If uninjured your specimen has six legs Why don t they step on 
each other Notice the stiff hairs on the legs and the white pads 
under the feet How would these structures be useful to the animal 

The large black shiny eyes are on the front and sides of the 
head the long horns or feelers are attached just below the eyes 
Upon which sense sight or feeling do you think the roach depends on 
more Explain your statement 

Beside the mouth are a long and a short pair of feelers perhaps 
these are for tasting or smelling What do roaches like to eat Do 
they choose their food What damage do they do 

How can a house be rid of cockroaches 

THE LIVING SPIDER 


Living spiders preferably large ones in cages individual specimens 
in battery jars or wide mouth bottles Cocoons Simple lenses 


Each pupil may feel sure that if treated fairly any of the common 
spiders may be handled without fear of bite or injury 

Note that the spider s body is of two regions the head thorax and 
the abdomen and that it is supported by eight legs To what part of 
the body are the legs attached 

Find the feelers if they are club shaped your specimen is a 
male State their number and tell where they are attached What is 
the sex of your spider 

Usually there are eight tiny near-sighted eyes on the front of the 
head State the color of the eyes and by a diagram indicate their 
arrangement 

With what kind of material is the body covered use the lens 

What is the color of your specimen What special markings has it 

Find out the name of your kind of spider 

Holding the spider aloft in your fingers allow it to drop upon 
the thread it will spin and watch it climbs and spin Record the 
number of the spinners their situation and how they act Are the 
threads sticky If so why doesn t the spider stick to its web Is 
the web used for a home or for a snare 

Try to discover how the feet are enabled to cling to the thread 

Examine a cocoon noting its outer form and structure and look 
for an opening at the top If you can open a cocoon carefully with 
scissors look for its two coats and inspect its contents 

State three uses for the spider s silk 

What is the work of spiders amongst the animal population of 
the earth or of what use are they 

Out of doors find webs of various kinds wheel web tent web 
triangle web etc 

How do the jumping spiders differ from others in their 
spinning and feeding habits 

Look up what is meant by ballooning spiders Find out when 
ballooning occurs and what is accomplished by it

b A cocoon 


THE LIVING CRICKET 


Materials 

Living crickets in cages with materials for food and concealment 
and individual specimens in wide mouth bottles or vials with cotton 
stoppers 


Observations 

What is the average size and the general color of crickets 

Just what do they do when you try to catch them What structures 
enable them to do these things 

Of the three pairs of legs which extend side wise for running or 
grasping and which backward for jumping or climbing What structures 
have the legs to enable them to do their work properly 

Notice how well-developed the cricket s wings are and state how 
much they are used or how they influence the habits of the animal 

How many projecting spines are there on the hinder end of the 
body Are they ornamental or useful How The female crickets have a 
special spear shaped spine for depositing eggs 

In a column make a list of the senses sight feeling etc and 
opposite each state what kind of organ is used and where it is 
located The ears are oblong white spots on the second-long piece of 
the front legs 

Find out whether the cricket chews solid food or sucks liquid 
food and whether it has biting jaws or protrusile lips See whether 
it will attack a toothpick or your finger and if the crickets 
have been confined long whether there has been any attempt at 
cannibalism Is its natural food animal or vegetable matter 

How do crickets chirp 

What work do they do in nature 

How does a baby cricket develop 


THE LIVING GRASSHOPPER OR LOCUST 


Materials 

Individual specimens in wide mouth bottles or jars and other 
specimens in cages with turf or foliage for food and concealment 
Simple lenses 


Observations 

Notice the form and size of your specimen its color the number of 
its legs and of its feelers Find the eyes the two large eyes a 
tiny one between the two feelers and near the inner edge of each 
large eye another tiny one With a lens notice the markings on the 
large eyes Find the mouth and note its lips and finger like 
feelers Draw out an outer wing and then carefully draw out the 
delicate under wing allowing them both to fold into place again 
Under the wings find the circular or crescent shaped membranes the 
eardrums Watch the grasshopper s body expand and contract in 
breathing and find the small breathing holes along each side the 
body Compare its rate of breathing with your own 


Questions 

In what surroundings and how does the grasshopper s color protect 
it What color markings has it which might serve for other 
grasshoppers to see as signals Explain how this signaling is done 

Explain how the legs are placed to act as springs in jumping 
and alighting 

What advantages in having the wings attached on the upper side and 
the legs on the under side of the body 

Explain how the small wings are protective and how the large ones 
are protected 

Why is it better for the grasshopper to have its mouth on the 
under side of its head instead of in front 

The large eyes are supposed to be far-sighted the small ones 
near-sighted State how the large eyes have the more advantageous 
position and around how much of a circle they can see 

Describe how the grasshopper breathes 


THE LIVING BUTTERFLY OR MOTH 


Materials 

Individual specimens in large jars or cages and other specimens in 
cages with foliage simple lenses and a needle or pin 


Observations 

Butterflies may generally be distinguished from moths by their habit 
of holding their wings together above them when at rest by the 
feelers which are knob bed at the end and by the rather slender 
abdomen Moths generally either fold their wings or hold them 
outstretched their feelers are not knob bed and their bodies are 
rather bulky 

Observe these points in your specimen and the colors of the upper and 
under sides of the wings Find the large eyes and examine them with a 
lens With the needle or pin carefully uncoil the sucking tube which 
you may find under the head between two shields Note the fuzziness 
of the body and the dust which covers the wings Examine some of 
this dust under a lens 


Questions 

Is your specimen a butterfly or a moth Prove your statement If 
possible give the name of your specimen 

Write a description of your specimen its size general color and 
special color pattern 

Describe the sucking tube or proboscis and name some flowers 
from which it might obtain nectar Try to find out how the tube is 
operated 

Why is it that moths and butterflies never bite Do they sting 
How do you think they protect themselves from enemies 

State how the fuzz and dust on your specimen might influence a 
bird s liking for it 

Contrast the size and usefulness of the wings of the butterfly 
with those of some other insect you know about contrast their legs 
state how development of one set of structures may cause another set 
to be simple or feeble 

Most moths are active by night What explanation can you give for 
their large eyes and expanded feelers Feelers of insects may be for 
any or all of the following touch taste smell and hearing 


Suggested drawings 

a The butterfly or moth 

b An antenna feeler 


THE LIVING CATERPILLAR 


Materials 

Living caterpillars in cages or covered jars for individual study 
and other specimens in cages with foliage for food or concealment 


Observations 

The pupil should observe the general form and external construction 
of the caterpillar watching it feeding in action and at rest 

Notice how the creature moves Find its head its segments similar 
divisions of the body and its breathing holes along the sides of 
the body Try to find its eyes any feelers wings or paddles Try to 
loosen it from its support find the tiny hooks on the feet for 
clinging fast 


Questions 

Give the general color of your specimen and explain how this color 
may make it conspicuous or may aid its concealment 

Describe the outer surface or covering of the caterpillar What 
structures if any are there which might make the animal 
distasteful or inedible 

How many pairs of legs are there How are they distributed along 
the body Counting the segments state which ones bear no legs 

To what extent do the legs act in locomotion Are they mere organs 
for attachment while the body swings forward and backward or do the 
legs do this as in a horse Make a complete statement 

Notice the openings of the internal breathing tubes How are they 
protected against dust and other foreign matter 

Does the caterpillar seem to be a warm blooded animal State how 
the free access of air along the body would influence internal 
temperature 

What do you know about a caterpillar s appetite How might 
caterpillars be beneficial or harmful What means has nature of 
holding their numbers in check 

Recalling that caterpillars finally sleep for several days or 
weeks and awaken as winged creatures how can you account for their 
appetites 


THE TUSSOCK MOTH 


Materials 

Directions for the study of the caterpillar stage will be found in 
the exercise The Living Caterpillar and directions for the study 
of the adult male form will be found in the exercise The Living 
Butterfly or Moth The female tussock moth is a wingless 
thick bodied creature gray very downy and about three 
fourths of an inch long The following directions apply more 
particularly to the study of the cocoons and the general harmfulness 
of the tussock moth 

This exercise may be done best outside of the classroom the pupil 
answering the questions on scrap paper and rewriting these notes in 
the laboratory Living caterpillars cocoons some of them bearing 
their frothy masses of wax and eggs pupas and adult moths of both 
sexes may be used in the laboratory 


Observations and Questions 

On what kinds of trees are the cocoons and the caterpillars 
generally found What effect have the caterpillars on the trees and 
what may be the final effect upon the trees of the locality 
or the entire district 

Upon what part of the tree are the cocoons made and why Where on 
the bark are they and why 

Is the opening of the cocoon at the upper or the lower end What 
reason can you assign for this 

Count the number of cocoons upon the entire tree or estimate it by 
counting those upon a part of the tree Now count the number of eggs 
on a cocoon Assuming that one half of the cocoons bear eggs 
calculate the number of caterpillars on a tree next year 

How is the waxy covering of the eggs a particularly good 
protection against winter weather 

Investigate the interiors of several cocoons and state what you 
find 

On the pupa find the jointed and tapering hinder end abdomen and 
at the head region and lying along the under side the marks of the 
legs and the feelers and possibly the wings all pressed close 
against the body Find also the breathing pores along the sides of 
the abdomen 

Unlikeness between male and female is called sexual isomorphism 
Explain how the tussock moth shows this For what work does each form 
seem particularly adapted 

What methods would you use that the tussock moth might be 
destroyed or kept out of a community 

The numerous small worm like creatures often found are the 
caterpillar stages of another insect an ichneumon fly which 
laid its eggs under the skin of the tussock caterpillar How has 
their development affected that of the tussock moth What great 
result does nature accomplish by this arrangement

b A cocoon with its egg mass 

c A pupa as seen from the under side 

d An adult moth either male or female 


THE LIVING BEETLE 


Materials 

Living beetles in cages together with portions of the plant upon 
which they are found or if water beetles are used they should be 
kept in Aquarian Individual specimens in battery jars or wide mouth 
bottles and preserved beetles in pans or vials for reference 


Observations 

Upon what plant or in what surroundings is your kind of beetle 
generally found If you can give its common name 

What is the length breadth and thickness of your beetle Would 
you describe it as a small insect or a large one 

Of what general color is it Describe any color markings you see 

If any of the legs differ from the others or are of peculiar 
shape or length describe them and tell what you think they may be 
fitted to do 

As a rule beetles have harder shells than other insects Does 
this shell completely inclose the body or can you find any soft 
parts exposed How are the head thorax and abdomen joined to 
carry out the apparent purpose of protection What is the outline of 
the body a continuous line or one with many irregularities 

If possible try to lift up one side of the shell from the 
hinder end of the body You will discover that this portion of the 
shell is a pair of hard sheath wings and beneath them is another 
pair How are the under ones unlike the upper and texture in 
use in arrangement when not in use 

Does a beetle spend most of its life on the wing like bees and 
flies How might the body covering and the structure of the outer 
wings affect or determine the beetle s habits even against its will 

Are the feelers or are the eyes of your specimen more easily 
distinguished Upon which of the special senses does it seem to place 
most dependence 

Is your kind of beetle good for anything either in nature or in 
human affairs Make a statement regarding what good or what harm it 
may do 


THE DAMSEL FLY LARVA 


Materials 

Living larva of the damsel fly in shallow watch glasses of water for 
individual use and others in large pans or Aquarian Simple lenses or 
dissecting microscopes 


Observations 

What is the color and the shape of the larva How long is it 
Notice in what surroundings in the water the larva lives and answer 
to yourself how its form and color would protect it in those 
surroundings 

Since the larva is an insect though immature its body is 
composed of three regions head thorax and abdomen How do these 
regions differ from each other 

What structures has your specimen to enable it to move from place 
to place If fully developed wings are not present what indication 
is there of their being formed 

What sense organs has the larva Which ones seem to be the largest 
and most useful 

Although the aquatic larva is preparing for adult life in the air 
there should be some arrangement for securing air in the water Where 
do you find outgrowths of the skin which might increase the 
air absorbing surface How many of these structures are there Look 
within them for the air tubes fine branching black lines 

If possible without injury to the specimen examine the larva s 
mouth Try to discover how it is used and how it is protected when 
not in use

plants are they found Does the plant show any indication of being 
harmed by the lice If so how 

Make a count of the plant lice upon a portion of a plant and 
estimate the whole number upon a plant Why are plant lice a very 
serious pest 

If any plant lice have ants associated with them study the 
behavior of the ants in this curious relationship What advantages 
result from this relationship of ant and aphis to either or both 
insects

in your collection How do they differ in form and size and color 

Remove a scale and study it carefully with a lens What is under 
the scale Of what is the scale composed What do you discover about 
these bugs to indicate that they are really insects 

What can be said about the number of scale bugs Why are they 
difficult to exterminate How can they be distributed from one place 
to another as from orchard to orchard since only the males have 
wings 


Drawings suggested

process Where is the air stored for use when under water Does the 
bug sink or rise when it stops swimming Why 

Identify the bug s mouth parts What is their appearance and 
probable manner of use How are the forelegs fitted for grasping 
food 

What is the shape of the body What is the position of the wings

cross at their tips Are they smooth throughout and sheath like or 
are they thick at the base and thin at the tips 


Summary 

Summarize your study of the bug by enumerating the various ways the 
bug is adapted for life in the water 


Water Beetles 


Use the same questions for the study of water beetles as for water 
bugs In addition answer the following 

Identify the eyes of the whirligig beetle and note their peculiar 
construction How can you explain this peculiar form of the eyes on 
the basis of use Why are the antenna of both water bugs and beetles 
so small

CHAPTER II 

STUDIES OF INSECTS 

The effect of great numbers upon the structure and habits of 
animals The use of keys in finding the names of animals 


FIELD STUDIES 


Materials 

Boxes for carrying insects A net This may be homemade 
using mosquito netting or fish net and a stout wire If it is to be 
used for a dragnet for water insects the wire must be stout and the 
netting strong Make the net twice as long as wide A cyanide 
jar for killing insects A few paper triangles for carrying 
butterflies A notebook 

Note Your instructor will give directions for obtaining the 
material called for in and 


Directions 

Look carefully and quietly in the various situations noted below Do 
not be in a hurry Weedy meadows or vacant lots and neglected 
roadsides are good places for your first trips Note concerning each 
insect found a its name or something by which to identify it b 
where you found it c what it was doing d its probable food 
Record these observations in your notebook Make a special study of 
such insects as your instructor may designate 


Where to look for Various Insects 


Grasshoppers locusts katydids Look along roadsides waste 
places gardens especially weedy ones weedy lots and grassy 
meadows and pastures 

Crickets Under old boards along the edges of board or stone 
walks along fences 

Beetles Some locations as for crickets and also on flowering 
plants under loose bark of trees and stumps in rotten logs etc 
For water beetles drag edges of ponds and streams 

Dragon flies Along water courses ponds and swamps Drag ponds 
and ditches for larva 

Bees On flowering plants especially on large patches of wild 
asters golden rods and thistles 

Wasps Sandy stretches especially along the water amongst 
flowering plants under the eaves and roofs of outbuildings Nests 
may be found in these latter places 

Butterflies and moths In fields where there are many flowering 
plants look carefully on the leaves of plants for caterpillars and 
for eggs Also look very carefully on the under side of leaves on 
twigs and on the bark of trees for chrysalis of butterflies and 
cocoons of moths 

Bugs In some locations as for bees and grasshoppers and water 
beetles Also on fruit 

Aphids On the fresh growing tops of plants 

Tree hoppers On trees and shrubs Hold your net on the under side 
of branches and shake the branch vigorously 

Flies Around decaying substances as garbage fruit etc on 
flowering plants 

Ants Sandy waste places decayed logs along walks often in 
kitchens 

Note At night many kinds of insects fly around electric 
lights or into open windows attracted by the light and may 
easily be collected 


Form for Field Trip Report 


The notes taken on a field trip may be conveniently tabulated for 
permanent record in the form indicated below 

FIELD TRIP REPORT 

Date Time Locality Pupil s Name 

Name of Insect Where Found What it was Doing Probable Food 




In case the name of the insect is not known to you use a number and 
some designation as to color or other mark by which it may be known 
until you have leisure to look up its name by means of keys or books 
on insects 


Special Field Studies 


The questions below may be used for a more careful field study of any 
insect 

Just where was the insect found 

Note carefully what the insects are doing before they are 
disturbed by your presence What did the insects do when you 
disturbed them If you think this related to securing safety explain 
what leads you to think so 

What senses do you conclude are well-developed Reason for your 
conclusion 

Has the insect a home If so what is its character 

What is the color What is the relation between the color of the 
insect and its surroundings 

Is the insect solitary in its habits or associated with others of 
the same species If in association with others note the numbers 
and what they are doing 

What modes of locomotion do you observe in this insect Which is 
the most common If it flies or jumps note the distance 

If you find the young note whether they differ from the adult in 
general appearance and if so in what ways they differ Do they 
differ in food 

What other insects do you find in the same habitat

Regions principal divisions of the body of an animal 

Head thorax and abdomen the three distinct regions into 
which the body of a grasshopper is divided 

Somite a ring like division of the body of an animal 

Pro thorax mesothorax and meta thorax the three divisions or 
somites into which the thorax of any insect is divided A pair of 
legs is borne on each division 

Exoskeleton an external skeleton 

Femur tibia and tarsus the three principal divisions of the 
leg corresponding to thigh shank and foot

female used to deposit eggs 

Metamorphosis refers to the development of the young of animals 
when striking changes in structure occur in the course of their 
growth Metamorphosis is called complete when the young have no 
resemblance to the adults and incomplete when there is a 
resemblance to the adult In complete metamorphosis the stages are 
larva pupa and adult In incomplete metamorphosis the stages 
are nymph and adult

CHAPTER III 

THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION 


A STUDY OF THE CELL AND OF PROTOZOA 

To show what Single Cells can Do 


Materials 

Some single cells of plant or animal tissue stained to show 
structure Slides of a one celled animal stained Living one celled 
animals 


Definitions 

Cell the smallest living unit 

Protoplasm the living material composing the cell 

Nucleus a dense bit of protoplasm usually near the center of the 
cell often staining dark 

Cytoplasm the less dense protoplasm outside of the nucleus 
usually taking a lighter stain 

Nucleolus para nucleus or micro nucleus a very small dense 
dark staining body either within the nucleus nucleolus or near it 
para nucleus or micro nucleus 

Cell wall the lifeless membrane surrounding many cells secreted 
by the protoplasm 

Food balls bits of food inside the cells of many one celled 
animals usually showing through the walls 

Food vacuole a small drop of water containing digestive material 
and a food ball 

Contracting or pulsating vacuoles small clear spots in the 
cell filled with water In the living cell these disappear at 
intervals and then appear again 

Oral groove a funnel shaped groove in one side of someone celled 
animals conducting food to the mouth In paramecium it often shows 
as an oblique line when the animal rolls 

Gullet the inner end of the oral groove 

Cilia numerous minute vibrating protoplasmic hairs on the 
surface of many cells 

Respiration the passage of oxygen into the tissues of a living 
organism and of carbon dioxide out of them These gases can pass 
through any thin moist organic membrane When such a membrane 
separates two fluids which differ in the amount of oxygen they 
contain oxygen passes to the fluid containing the smaller amount 
The same is true of carbon dioxide Respiration is believed to occur 
in all living organisms 

This passage of fluids through membranes is known as osmosis 

Digestion the process of making food materials soluble so that 
they can pass through membranes and be used to build up protoplasm A 
few forms of cells are able to take in solid food and digest it in 
their protoplasm but most cells can admit only fluid food 

Fission a method of reproduction used in all cells by which a 
cell divides itself into two usually through the center In someone celled animals this may be preceded by conjugation when two 
animals unite temporarily and exchange nuclear substance or in some 
forms two cells may fuse and the resulting cell may divide Budding 
is a form of fission in which a small projection is formed on the 
parent cell and then cut off making a new individual 

Protozoa first animals animals of one cell existing alone or in 
loose colonies 


Observations 

Examine a single cell stained to show structure Identify 
the nucleus cytoplasm and if present the nucleolus or the 
micro nucleus and the cell wall Draw to show the form of the cell 
and the details of its structure Label all details 

Examine some stained paramecia Select a typical one and identify 
in it nucleus micro nucleus cytoplasm and cell wall or cell 
membrane You may also be able to see vacuoles looking like holes in 
the stained protoplasm Give reasons for considering this animal to 
be a single cell Draw one to show its cellular structure Label all 
details 

Clean a slide and cover glass place a drop of water containing 
living paramecia on the slide cover it and examine What structures 
do you see which you saw in the stained paramecia What structures do 
not show Identify any new structures you may observe Identify also 
the leading end and the side containing the oral groove 

Describe the shape of the animal 

What is the actual length of the animal 

After watching the animal for some time describe the path 
followed by a given specimen as it crosses the field of the 
microscope What reason can you see if any why this paramecium is 
moving What external factors if any seem to determine the path it 
follows 

How rapidly do paramecia really move What structures do they use 
in locomotion 

How do they manage to move in one direction instead of 
alternately backward and forward How do they manage to move in a 
straight line though their bodies are not symmetrical 

What is the food of the paramecia How do they find it Find a 
specimen at rest and watch the oral groove Suggest a method by which 
food may be collected into it If possible note the process of 
swallowing and the resulting food ball 

Note If powdered carmine be placed in the water with some 
paramecia it can be seen in the food balls a half hour or so 
later 

Where are the food balls located Watch them in an individual 
until you notice their motion Where are the larger food balls The 
smaller ones Assuming them to have been of approximately equal sizes 
when they were taken in how can you account for differences now 

Where are the contracting vacuoles How many are there How often 
does one contract 

What is their function 

As you have been studying paramecia to what external influences 
as contact heat light etc have you seen them respond How do 
they show it when they do respond Is such a response an advantage to 
them or not What would be the result if they were not able to detect 
changes in their surroundings 

Where does respiration occur in paramecia Where do they obtain 
their supply of oxygen 

amongst the paramecia you are studying you usually find at least 
one in the process of fission Watch it until the halves separate if 
you can Compare the halves Do they rank as parent and offspring If 
so which is which If not which are they parent or offspring

A STUDY OF SPONGES 

To show how cells loosely associated may work together 


Materials 

The simplest of the many celled animals are the sponges which with 
one exception are salt water forms That one the spongilla is not 
easily found and is very difficult to maintain in the laboratory For 
these reasons the material for this study is very meager except at 
the seashore and much of the work must be done from diagrams and 
reference books Small simple preserved sponges and complex toilet 
sponge skeletons will also be used 


Definitions 

Body wall the outer wall in bodies of the many celled animals 

Central cavity the cavity surrounded by the body wall in the 
simpler many celled animals as in the sponges 

Canals channels through the body walls of sponges 

Inhalant pores the outer ends of the canals 

ESTIA the inner ends of the canals 

Oculus the large opening of the central cavity at the distal end 
of the sponge 

Spicules tiny needles of mineral substance found in the walls of 
many sponges 

Fibers flexible threads of horny material found in the walls of 
many sponges 

Endoderm cells cells lining the canals They have cilia or 
flagella projections larger than cilia 

Ectoderm cells cells covering the outside of sponges and some 
other animals In sponges it is believed that endoderm and ectoderm 
cells are able to exchange positions and functions 

Mesoglea a jelly like layer between the endoderm and ectoderm 
layers In the sponges this contains many wandering cells probably 
from the other layers 

Porifera pore bearers animals with many more or less independent 
cells supported by solid skeletal parts and penetrated by a system 
of canals which open on the surface as pores 


Directions 

Study a simple sponge to see the shape size and point of 
attachment Identify the Oculus In a diagram of a long section of a 
simple sponge identify the central cavity body walls canals 
inhalant pores ESTIA and Oculus In a simple sponge cut like the 
diagram identify the same structures Do the same for the toilet 
sponge 

Study a diagram of a portion of the body wall considerably enlarged 
Identify the endoderm and ectoderm cells the spicules or fibers 
and amongst the spicules or fibers irregular amyloid cells sometimes 
called mesoderm cells 

Examine a fragment or section of each kind of sponge under the 
microscope Notice the arrangement shape and length of the spicules 
and of the fibers 

Test both kinds of sponges by dropping a bit of each into weak acid 
and noting the results Also burn a bit of each and notice the odor 


Questions 

What is the shape of a simple sponge What enables a mass of cells 
to retain such a definite shape 

What seems to be the composition of the skeletons Why is one type 
of skeleton rigid and the other elastic 

Since sponges are attached for most of their lives to stationary 
objects suggest means for obtaining food and oxygen and for getting 
rid of waste matter 

Although individual cells are sensitive a sponge as a whole is 
not What connection has this fact with the fact that sponges are 
stationary 

Compare simple and complex sponges 


Suggested drawings

Anterior end the head end usually the leading end 

Posterior end the end opposite the anterior end 

Ventral surface the lower surface usually the one which contains 
the mouth 

Dorsal surface the one opposite the ventral surface 

Somites the rings or segments of which some animal bodies are 
composed 

Bilateral symmetry the symmetry usually shown by animals which 
have differentiated dorsal and ventral surfaces and right and left 
sides Animals which do not have such differentiated surfaces are 
usually radially symmetrical but sometimes asymmetrical without 
symmetry 

Girdle the somewhat transparent band frequently found near the 
anterior end of an earthworm

in a wet tray or upon moist paper Identify the anterior and 
posterior ends the dorsal and ventral surfaces and the right and 
left sides Identify also the somites and the girdle the mouth with 
its projecting lip and the anal opening

closely for some time and discover how it is able to move from place 
to place Suggestion What is the function of the set in this 
process How can you explain the alternate contraction and expansion 
of parts 

From time to time for perhaps a week examine the leaves which 
were scattered where the worms could reach them Have the worms moved 
them about at all If so where are the leaves left Have any been 
eaten in part or entirely If so is there any evidence of 
selection either as to the kind of leaf or the portion of leaf 
eaten If earthworms select food what senses would be useful for the 
purpose Have you any evidence that earthworms possess such senses

seen more easily in some regions than in others This is the dorsal 
blood vessel How long is it Where is it wider Where narrower 
Notice its pulsations How many times per minute does it pulsate In 
which direction is the blood forced Is there a corresponding ventral 
blood vessel Place a small worm between two pieces of glass so that 
you may see through it more easily and identify the blood vessels 
encircling the digestive canal near the anterior end These are the 
so called hearts of the earthworm If possible decide in which 
direction the blood flows through them

CHAPTER IV 

ADAPTATION TO SURROUNDINGS 


A STUDY OF Crustacean 

To Show the General Adaptation of an Invertebrate to its 
Surroundings 


A STUDY OF CRAYFISHES 


Materials 

Crayfishes living and preserved Some living crayfishes 
should be established in conditions as natural as possible i e in 
an inch or so of fresh water with rocks weeds etc and left 
undisturbed Small crayfishes are desirable to show locomotion in 
water 


Living Crayfishes 


Directions and observations 

Observe living crayfishes in their usual habitat or in a large 
aquarium without disturbing them and see where they stay when they 
are free to choose Notice their position What senses are on guard 
What is the color of the head and claws How may this color aid the 
animal in getting food or in escaping enemies Why is the color of 
the posterior region less important than the color of the anterior 

Offer them bits of meat If one takes food notice the appendages 
it uses How does it discover the food With what appendages do it 
grasp the food How is the food conveyed to the mouth With what 
senses if any do the animal test the food as it eats it 

If the crayfishes are in plenty of water and you startle them in 
any way some of them may swim Watch for such an occurrence and 
notice it carefully How is swimming accomplished Which end leads in 
swimming How far does the animal swim at a stroke How long does it 
continue to swim Where does it go Does it see where it is going 
For what purpose would this method of locomotion be useful 

Place a living crayfish in a tray with water to cover it and take 
it to your table Watch the crayfish as it walks about in the water 
then take it out and let it walk out of water Compare the two 
processes What causes the differences 

How many appendages are used in walking What order if any is 
there in moving the legs Which method walking or swimming does it 
use in going to some particular spot e g in going to find food or 
cover Why 

Gently turn the animal on its back and watch the movements of its 
appendages as it rights itself Which appendages does it use and how 
does it use them How can it manage to use so many appendages in 
harmony for one result 

For what different purposes have you seen the crayfishes use their 
large claws For which does the claw seem best fitted Can you think 
of any change which would make it more efficient for its main 
purpose If so describe the change and tell how it would work 

Test the distribution of the sense of feeling Is it anywhere 
especially acute If so where Why have two pairs of feelers Where 
is each pair carried when the animal is at rest when it is in 
motion How much territory can the two pairs guard 

Touch the eyes Compare their sensitiveness with that of your own 
eyes What movements can the eyes perform How are they protected 
What range of territory can they guard 

What other senses if any do you think a crayfish has Why do 
you think so 

Early in the spring crayfishes may be found carrying eggs or 
young If such a specimen is at hand notice where and how the eggs 
or young are attached How many are there How are they cared for 
Can the young crayfish let go If removed can they attach themselves 
again How much care does the mother give them when they are removed 


Morphology of a Crayfish 


Definitions 

Cephalo thorax the anterior half of the body divided into the 
head and the thorax 

Cervical groove the groove dividing the head from the thorax 

Abdomen the posterior half of the body consisting of a number of 
somites 

Note The central part of the tail fin is usually included as 
a somite 

Carapace the continuous she ll like portion of the exoskeleton 
covering the cephalo thorax 

Rostrum the sharp projection of the carapace at the anterior end 

Gill chamber a pocket on each side of the thorax covered by a 
flap of the carapace 

Appendages paired structures attached to the body They are named 
as follows 

Eyestalks These are not classed as appendages by all students 

Antennules the small feelers 

Antenna the large feelers 

Mandibles the jaws one on each side of the mouth 

Maxilla the two pairs of small mouth parts just back of the 
mandibles 

Maxillipeds the three pairs of appendages between the maxilla 
and the large claws 

Helipads the large claws or pinchers 

Walking legs the four pairs of appendages back of the helipads 

Swimmers the appendages on the abdomen 

Openings five on the ventral surface as follows 

The openings from the excretory organs through small white cones 
on the bases of the antenna 

The mouth farther back between the maxillipeds 

The anal opening in the last segment of the abdomen 

The opening from the reproductive gland toward the posterior 
part of the thorax 


Observations 

How large is your specimen How does it compare in size with other 
crayfishes in the laboratory 

Describe the shape of the body contrasting the anterior end with 
the posterior and the dorsal surface with the ventral 

Study the amount of motion permitted in different parts of the 
body What prevents motion What permits it Where is the body most 
flexible Why Where is it most rigid Why 

How much of the surface is covered with exoskeleton What 
arrangement is there to permit the animal to feel contact 

How can the animal grow with such an exoskeleton 

Place a dead crayfish in dilute acid for a few hours What is the 
result What has the acid done Explain the fact that crayfishes are 
often found alive and well with a soft shell 

Compare the cephalo thorax with the abdomen as to size shape and 
flexibility 

How many somites are there in the abdomen Which way does it bend 
Study the somite shells on every side and then state what there is in 
their construction which determines the direction and amount of their 
motion How are the somite shells arranged to protect the body during 
bending How is the ventral surface of the abdomen protected 

Where are the appendages attached Study a walking leg and 
describe its general construction the number and kind of joints the 
direction of motion in each joint and the range of motion for the 
whole leg Study an antenna in the same way What methods are used in 
the crayfish to secure a wide range of motion To secure flexibility 

Carefully split a crayfish into right and left halves To do this 
first cut through the ventral exoskeleton from end to end with 
scissors then with a sharp knife or razor cut through to the dorsal 
exoskeleton and cut that with the scissors Study one half to get a 
better idea of the attachment of the appendages These may then be 
removed and placed in order on a piece of paper upon which a list of 
the appendages has been written 

How many pairs of appendages are there How may they be grouped 
according to location how grouped according to function How many 
pairs are there in each group 

What similarities of structure do you find in nearly all the 
appendages Assuming a swimmeret of the third fourth or fifth 
somite to be the least changed from the primitive type what changes 
were necessary to make the sixth swimmeret the third maxilliped the 
walking legs the antenna the antennules 

Remove the part of the carapace which covers a gill chamber What 
are the boundaries of the chamber Where does it open to the water 

Describe the appearance and the texture of a gill How are the 
gills kept moist when the crayfish is in water when it is on land 
Why should they be kept moist 

Would you class the gills as external structures or as internal 
Why do you think so To what are they attached How are the gills 
affected by the motion of the legs 

What work goes on in the gills How is the supply of oxygen 
renewed In this connection try a live crayfish kept quiet in 
water just about deep enough to cover it Float bits of paper 
near it or carefully place a drop of ink in the water near it By 
some such method currents of water may usually be shown and 
their direction determined Consider also the habitual motions of 
mouth parts and swimmers the bubbles sometimes seen when a 
crayfish is dropped into water and the habit crayfishes have of 
lying on one side close to the surface of the water

the mantle They are often called shellfish as most of the forms have 
a shell 

Lamellibranchiata or Pelecypoda names given to the class of 
Molluscan to which the clam belongs The former term refers to the 
broad flap like gills and the latter to the hatchet like foot

Hinge ligament the elastic structure which fastens the valves 
together at the dorsal margin 

Um bones a pair of elevations near the anterior end of the shell 

Lines of growth concentric lines around the um bones 

Siphons two openings at the posterior end of the clam the upper 
opening is the ex current opening and the lower the incurrent In 
the salt water clam the siphons form a long tube usually called the 
neck 

Hinge teeth projections near the dorsal margin on the inner 
surface of the shell The anterior irregular structure is the 
cardinal and the more posterior blade like structure is the 
lateral tooth 

Muscle scars scar like markings on the inner surface of the shell 
indicating the point where muscles were attached The large scar just 
in front of the cardinal tooth is the anterior abductor muscle 
scar and the one just back of the lateral tooth is the posterior 
abductor muscle scar 

Pallial line a line connecting the two muscle scars 

Mantle folds of skin covering the body of the clam and lying close 
to the inner surface of the valves 

Foot a hatchet shaped structure extending from the ventral edge of 
the body 

Gills broad flap like structures for respiration situated each 
side of the body in the mantle cavity They consist of a double fold 
of membrane through which run many perforations lined with cilia The 
waving of these cilia cause the current of water needed for 
respiration 

Palps small flap like structures near the anterior end of the 
clam They surround the mouth On their surface are cilia which cause 
currents of water toward the mouth

and proceed as follows Raise one valve separate the mantle from it 
and then cut through the two large firm structures abductor muscles 
found at each end What does the valve do when the muscles are cut 
What is the cause of this State your theory as to how a clam opens 
and closes its shell

their extent How are the lobes related to the valves 

Remove or lift up one mantle lobe Identify the soft body the 
foot the gills the palps and the mouth Which of these structures 
are arranged in pairs

study and a few fishes in a large aquarium where they have 
considerable freedom of motion 


Definitions 

Trunk the portion of the body between the head and the tail 

Compressed a term used to describe the shape of the body when it 
is narrower from side to side than from dorsal to ventral surface 
When the opposite is true the body is said to be flattened 

Median fins the unpaired fins situated on the median line dorsal 
and ventral including the tail or caudal fin the dorsal fin 
and the anal fin 

Paired fins fins occurring in pairs of which the more anterior are 
the pectoral fins and the posterior are the pelvic fins 

Fin rays the framework or skeleton of the fins over which membrane 
is stretched to form the fins Fin rays are of two kinds those 
composed of bone and those composed of cartilage 

Lateral line a sense organ extending along each side of the fish 
in a line indicated by tubes or perforations in the scales 

Gills respiratory organs adapted for taking oxygen from the water 

Pendulum the flaps covering the gills on each side of the head 

Pigment a substance which gives color to an object 


Observations 

Locomotion 

Watch the fishes in the large aquarium and determine which fins 
are most used and how they are used a in swimming forward b in 
swimming upward and downward c in maintaining balance d in 
remaining at rest and e in guiding the movements of the fish 

What advantages are there to the fish a in the power to open 
and close the dorsal and anal fins b in having no neck and 
c in having a compressed form 

Enumerate the various ways by which the body of the fish is 
adapted to rapid movement through the water 

Feeding 

What is the food of the fishes you are studying Feed them and 
watch them eat Why is the upper jaw often called a lip What is 
the shape and size of the mouth when opened in feeding Do the fish 
chew its food Describe in detail the fishes method of feeding 

Respiration 

Identify the opercula and the gill openings Watch the movements 
of the opercula and mouth and determine what movements are concerned 
in breathing and their order Describe in detail the circulation of 
water used in breathing and how it is caused 

Sense Organs 

Identify the eyes nostrils and lateral line How many nostrils 
are there and where located What is the position and extent of the 
lateral line 

Describe the location of the eyes What is the shape of the outer 
surface of the eyes Why this shape Can the eyes be moved i e 
can they be rotated rolled or retracted From what direction might 
an enemy approach without being seen How would such an enemy be 
detected 

Protection 

With what protective structures is the body covered Do they 
hinder the movements of the fish What are the advantages of the 
scale covering of fishes over the shell covering of grasshoppers or 
crayfishes 

In what other ways are the fishes you are studying protected 
against enemies Since you cannot account for the red color of 
goldfishes on the basis of use to the fish then how do you account 
for this bright color 

The Body 

What is the symmetry of the fish Into what regions is the body 
divided 


Summary of the study of the living fish 

Enumerate in one column the different adaptations which fit the fish 
for life in water and in a second column state the special purpose of 
each adaption 


The External Structure of the Fish 


Materials 

Freshly killed or preserved fish in dishes or shallow pans with 
enough water to prevent drying Simple or compound microscopes 
forceps and a bristle 


Directions 

Examine the fins and identify the membrane and the supporting rods 
or rays of bone or cartilage Notice how the ends of the 
cartilaginous rays keep the membrane from tearing 

Investigate the scales as to their arrangement number and size 
Remove a small patch of scales along the lateral line to find how 
they are attached where the fish s color is situated and how access 
to the sensory organs of the line is permitted Examine a scale under 
the microscope 

Observe the eyes and identify the parts similar to those of the human 
eye lid lash tear duct cornea iris and pupil 

In front of and between the eyes find the nostrils By means of a 
bristle determine whether these are connected and whether they do or 
do not open into the mouth or the throat 


Questions 

Make a list of the fins classifying them according to their 
structure 

Bearing in mind the differences in structure and consequent 
action what can you say regarding the adaptation of the several 
fins for protection For rigidity or flexibility in locomotion 

State how much of the body is covered with scales and where the 
largest and the smallest ones are found 

How are the scales arranged with reference to each other What 
benefit is derived from this in protection in locomotion If you 
have noticed any mucus or slime upon the body state its use 

Do the scales or the skin bear the pigment Give the color pattern 
of the kind of fish used in class How would this be useful to the 
fish in its natural home 

Describe the structure of a scale and state how it is attached to 
the skin In what way is the lateral line scale specialized 

State how when the fish is swimming the nostrils catch odors By 
means of a diagram with arrows show the probable direction of the 
water current through the nose 

State which of the structures of your eye are present in the 
fish s eye and which are missing Could a fish weep Wink How would 
a fish sleep 

Inasmuch as light penetrates water but a little way so that 
objects can be distinguished only within about thirty feet would the 
fish be nearsighted or farsighted 


Suggested drawings 

a A side view of the entire fish fully labeled 

b A bony rayed and a cartilaginous rayed fin 

c A scale showing its minute structure 

d A dorsal or a lateral view of the head showing the sense organs 


The Mouth and the Gills of the Fish 


Materials 

The same materials as those used in the preceding exercise may be 
used here 


Directions 

The mouth its structure and its action can be seen by pulling the 
upper jaw upward and forward until the mouth and the gill chambers 
open fully Examine the structure and action of the jaws the tongue 
the throat and the teeth on each jaw and on the roof of the mouth 

Investigate the breathing apparatus from the throat side and from the 
exterior noting the number form and structure of the gills their 
attachment and their protection 

The mouth may be kept open by a short splinter or a ball of paper 

The pupil should identify the following structures 

Gill an organ for breathing the air dissolved in water 

Gill arch an arch of bone or cartilage supporting the gills 

Gill filaments fringe like structures attached to the gill 
arches forming the gills 

Gill raker lateral projections from the gill arches 

Gill slits openings between the gill arches for the passage of 
water 

Pendulum the flap like covering of the gills on each side of 
the head 


Questions 

Compared with the size of its body how wide can the fish open its 
mouth What do you infer as to the size of its bite 

Are the jaws rigidly affixed to the skull Why should they be so 
attached or why not 

Of how many pieces is the upper jaw composed The under jaw 

Where are the teeth Judging from their form size and situation 
what do you think must be their use 

Do you think the tongue is used to assist in mastication in 
tasting in speech in swallowing 

How many gills are there and where are they situated How are 
they attached Which one is not free from the body throughout its 
length 

What probably causes the color of the gill filaments What is 
there in their number and texture which fits them for their 
function

Summary 

Write a complete account of how the fish eats and how it breathes 


Suggested drawings 

a A front view of the fish s face with the mouth fully open 

b A side view as above 

c A ventral view of the head with both gill chambers wide open and 
the gills separated from each other Indicate currents by arrows 

d A single gill 


The Alimentary Canal and the Circulatory System of the Fish 


Materials 

Small fresh fish shallow pans or dishes of water forceps and 
scissors 


Directions 

If the instructor has not opened the fish previously this is to be 
done by the student as follows On the ventral side insert the 
scissors in the vent in front of the anal fin and cut straight 
forward to a point between the opercula Care must be exercised in 
opening the chamber about the heart this lies between the gill 
chambers 

The various organs so far as possible should be carefully drawn out 
and separated in order that their structure may be distinguished 

The pupil should identify the following parts 

Body cavity the entire internal space divided by a membrane 
false diaphragm into a large abdominal cavity and a small 
chamber pericardial chamber between the gill chambers 

Liver a large red or pink mass lying at the front end of 
the abdominal cavity and divided into two unequal lobes The 
gall bladder thin walled and green may be seen between these 
lobes 

Alimentary canal 

a Mouth 

b Esophagus in the fish a very short tube 

c Stomach white and muscular beginning with a very short 
esophagus and ending as a blind sac If it is much distended 
open it to see what the fish may have eaten 

d Small intestine thin walled tubular and somewhat coiled 

e Large intestine a short thin walled expansion at the 
posterior end of the small intestine usually less than half an 
inch long 

f C ca from two to several small pouches attached where the 
small intestine leaves the stomach 

Spleen a reddish brown globule between the folds of the 
intestine 

Swim bladder an elongated chamber lying against the backbone 
partitioned off from the cavity below by a delicate membrane 

Peritoneum the delicate silvery membrane which lines the 
abdominal cavity and enfolds the viscera Note its spots of pigment 

Pericardial chamber the chamber around the heart see 
above 

Heart As the fish is placed belly upward in the pan the 
ventricle faces you pink conical and muscular Posterior to it 
on the dorsal side is the auricle a membranous sac 

Ventral aorta arising on the anterior surface of the ventricle 
as a white muscular cord really a tube which is enlarged close to 
the heart into a bulb the arterial bulb You should follow up this 
aorta until you see it divide right and left to send its branches 
outward into the gills the branches being called gill arteries 


Questions 

The fish frequently swallows its food alive Why should the 
stomach be muscular Why is it better that the intestine does not 
leave the stomach at the end opposite the esophagus 

Of what use can the c ca be What structure of the human intestine 
do you recall that is at all like them in form or use 

How many times the length of the body is the length of the 
alimentary canal Does this indicate that the fish is compelled to 
eat a great deal of poor food or that its food is highly nutritious 
so that little need be taken 

Near which end of the fish s body is the heart Is this the usual 
or the unusual condition amongst animals you know about What 
advantages can you think of in this arrangement 

What advantages are there in having the heart in a chamber 
separated from the other vital organs 

Of how many chambers does the heart consist Why should at least 
one of them be muscular 

How many times does the blood pass through the heart in making a 
complete circuit of the body Would you call this a single or a 
double circulation 

Does the heart force the blood onward or does it draw blood into 
itself i e is the heart a force pump or is it a suction pump 

How is circulation made complete If the heart is a force pump is 
its power sufficient to drive blood through artery capillary vein 
and into auricle if the capillaries can stand the pressure or is 
another action concerned If it is a suction pump why does the blood 
leave the heart

b The alimentary canal extended 

c The anterior end of the fish with the sinus held open to show the 
general situation of the parts 

d The heart in its chamber with the outgoing vessels as far as 
dissected Use arrows to show direction of circulation 

e A copy of some good diagram or chart which illustrates the heart 
of the fish with the connecting veins and arteries

Why Does the frog breathe in the usual manner while under the water 
If not how do you explain its ability to remain under water for a 
long period of time 

Sense Organs 

Investigate the efficiency of the five special senses in the frog 
by devising experiments to test each sense as for example giving a 
frog its liberty on the floor and trying to catch it again to test 
the sense of sight Write an account of your experiments and their 
results Which of the senses is best developed Give reasons for your 
answer 

Compare the eye of the frog with respect to its shape movements 
parts and protective structures with that of the fish In what 
respects are they similar in what respects different Why should 
they differ

Materials 

The materials used in this exercise are the same as those used in the 
preceding exercise 


Observations 

The pupil should identify the following structures 

Pericardium a membrane that surrounds the heart and in the case 
of the frog separates the body cavity into two portions the 
abdomen and the pericardial chamber 

Heart lying between the shoulders and in front of the false 
diaphragm It is conical in form and composed of three chambers 

Ventricle the pink conical and muscular portion of the heart 
pointing backward and outward 

Auricles right and left These are anterior and dorsal to the 
ventricle thin membranous and dark colored 

Arterial trunk the single large blood vessel usually empty of 
blood and white Note its origin and trace it as far as possible at 
least until you see it divide to encircle the throat 

Sinus venous a large membranous sac dorsal to the heart and 
connected with the right auricle 

Lungs two small oblong pink spongy sacs lying between and

The pupil may also identify the following structures if a 
specimen is available which has the blood vessels injected 

Conus arterioles or arterial trunk a large artery passing 
obliquely forward from the ventricle and dividing into three 
branches on each side

entering the single ventricle but by a simple device this 
scarcely occurs How would such commingling affect the purity of 
the blood as it reached the tissues and hence affect waste 
removal oxidation body temperature activity and intelligence 

What are the chambers of the fish s heart Of the mammalian 
human heart How may the heart of the frog be regarded as 
intermediate between these others How and where might the growth 
of a partition within it bring about the higher structure This

The Exoskeleton of the Bird Plumage 


Materials 

Living birds as perhaps pigeons or mounted or stuffed skins 
separate feathers portions of feathers microscopes 


Observations 

The pupils should study the arrangement of the feathers and their 
variations in form and size and should identify the following 
principal kinds 

Contour feathers those feathers generally broad which cover the 
body giving to it its outline and color 

Coverts those feathers which cover joints such as the joints of 
the wing and tail 

Primaries or pinions the long stiff feathers of the outside of 
the wing used in sustaining the bird in flight 

Secondaries the shorter more symmetrical feathers lying next and 
over the primaries 

Down soft feathers found on young birds and next to the skin on 
some adults 

Thread feathers best seen about the eyes ears and beak 

Quill the bare stiff portion one end of which is inserted in the 
skin Examine its internal structure 

Vane the broad expanded portion the part ordinarily seen on the 
bird

Birds and Migration 

To illustrate Distribution 


Work in the Laboratory 


Materials 

Bird skins or mounted birds at least one representative of each 
order and better still of each family of the birds which pass 
through or remain in your neighborhood specimens in a museum may 
also be used Some guide to the identification of birds as Walter s 
Wild Birds in City Parks or Reed s Bird Guide A good diagram of 
a bird 


Directions 

Your object here is to familiarize yourself with the appearance of 
birds of different types and with the terms used in describing them 
Study first a diagram of a bird and learn the terms and their 
applications 

An important item in the description of a bird is its length This is 
obtained by measuring from the tip of the beak over the curve of the 
head to the end of the tail This measures a curved line and gives a 
greater length for a bird than the straight line you would naturally 
estimate Train your eye by watching house sparrows so called 
English sparrows and fixing their length as a unit They are called 
six inches long and in the field other birds may be measured by 
them The robin is ten inches long and may be used to measure the 
larger birds 

In describing the colors of birds great discussions often arise 
because pupils do not use terms correctly Consult Chapman s Birds 
of Eastern North America for a color key or chart and train 
yourself to observe colors carefully and name them correctly You 
will find more colors amongst birds than are given there but the 
chart will help you a great deal 

Study in the laboratory as many birds as you can Try to get one of 
each order at least and amongst the perching birds one of each 
family The answers to the following questions should be recorded 
upon the blank outlines of birds or else in the form of a table 


Questions 

How long is the bird 

What is the general color of the upper surface of the lower 

What are the markings or peculiarities of the head if there are 
any 

Note any peculiarities of the tail as to shape length or color 
if there are any 

If the wings are not like the back note their color and if 
there are wing bars note their number and color 

What are the markings on the breast if there are any 

Note any other markings as rump spot etc 

What sort of beak has the bird 

What sort of feet has it 

Identify the bird using any key or guide you have Do not ask 
anyone to help you until you have exhausted your own resources 


Comparative Study of Birds 


In what ways do the feet of birds vary Give examples to 
illustrate your answer What are the principal results of these 
variations 

In what ways do the beaks of birds vary Give examples of the 
variations and of the special uses of the beaks 

How do water birds differ from land birds flesh eating birds from 
seed-eaters insect eating birds from seed-eaters shore and swamp 
birds from land birds 


Work in the Field 


Materials 

Birds in the field field or opera glasses and bird guides 
Some extra time as field work is rather slow Considerable 
energy as birds rise early and may be up and away before the usual 
hour for your appearance 


Directions 

The object of this work is to become acquainted with the living bird 
to learn not only its name but also some of its ways You will need 
to spend time to do this and as a rule the more time you spend the 
more you will see Every time you go out after birds record at the 
time every kind of bird you see so that at the end of the season 
you will know not only when each kind of bird came but also how long 
it staid When you see a new bird record immediately its colors 
markings actions notes and anything else which may help you later 
to identify it Do not trust to memory nor to the inspiration of the 
classroom After weeks of observation write the following summary

The Horse 


The pupil is expected to study carefully the account of Eohippus or 
Hyracotherium in his text or any other available reference book and 
to supplement that work and this brief sketch with original 
observations upon horses on the street at a local store or wherever 
possible or convenient 

From the early horses which migrated from North America there arose 
in Asia and Africa the ass famous in the history of early 
civilization and still used in some localities as beasts of burden or 
for the breeding of mules which are the crosses between ass and 
horse There also arose the zebra and the most primitive of modern 
horses Przewalskii s horse a wild pony of western China about 
forty inches high and almost identical with the drawings of the horse 
made by early man years ago Doubtless the modern ponies of 
Ireland Iceland and Shetland are descendants of the original 
Przewalskii type and not as is often claimed true horses stunted by 
rigors of climate and scant fare 

The horse is characterized largely by the presence of a lock of hair 
between the ears a full mane and tail small ears large hoofs and 
peculiar neigh The ass has no forelock a scanty mane and tail long 
ears small hoofs and a distinct bray 

By means of various crusades and raids the modern horse was 
introduced into Europe from Asia where it is clearly traced in 
history to the reign of King Solomon Here in Europe because of 
local conditions and demands it assumed differing type forms The 
roadster type is closest to the Arabian in character The draft or 
heavy type was bred in Western Europe when heavy armor came into use 
for rider and horse and the coach or carriage type was developed 
when armor was abandoned for gunpowder Finally explorers and 
colonists brought the horse back to America its original home 

The various types and varieties may be briefly described 

A The draft type has short legs short neck large round body and 
ranges in weight from pounds to pounds 

Varieties 

Percheron generally about pounds in weight hands 
inches high gray or black blocky body steep rump clean legs and 
quick action 

Shire generally about pounds in weight hands high bay 
or brown white marked feet and face hairy legs and feet and slow 
action 

Belgian generally about pounds in weight hands high 
chestnut or roan compact body short steep rump and small 
feet 

B The coach or carriage type has legs and neck of medium length a 
body full chested but not blocky and a weight varying from 
pounds to pounds 

Varieties 

Hackney generally of full broad powerful body short legs and 
back high action and high carriage of neck and head bay or chestnut hands high and pounds in weight 

Coach generally lighter than the Hackney with longer legs and 
long stride height hands weight pounds 

Cleveland bay averaging hands in height pounds in 
weight high broad hips strong action and bay color 

C The roadster type is long and lean of limb and body and 
averages about pounds in weight 

Varieties 

Thoroughbred of small head long neck level back of variable 
color hands high about pounds in weight 

American saddle an American production not a distinct breed 
but a roadster of high quality 

American trotter a superior type of good speed The off 
forefoot and the nigh hind foot act together the nigh fore and the 
off hind feet together giving a two beat gait 

Pacer similar to the trotter but using both off feet and both 
nigh feet together giving a swinging gait 

The horse is very similar to man in its physical and mental 
character being subject to the same ailments and treatment and 
having the same impulses of affection hatred fear jealousy 
obedience willfulness memory and perhaps reason It is of all 
animals most careful in its eating and drinking because its stomach 
is small the food should not be bulky but concentrated grain 
forming a goodly portion of the ration 

Perhaps the most important point in the structure of the horse is the 
form of the leg and foot The shoulder should slope slightly backward 
and the pastern joint immediately above the hoof slightly backward 
The hips or quarters should slope downward somewhat and the 
hock should be comparatively wide to afford ample leverage for the 
pulling muscles The legs should be straight as pillars when seen 
from front or rear The outer walls of the hoof support most of the 
weight though the frog should normally touch the ground In nature 
the hoof wears away properly of itself but the shod hoof needs 
regular trimming attention while the frog must not be trimmed for 
it is the soft growing part that nourishes the hoof In this 
treatment the foot is comparable with the human finger and finger 
nail 


Observations 

If access to a living animal is impossible or inconvenient the pupil 
may use reference book or pictures for most of these points A 
measuring tape or ruler should be at hand and the assistance of an 
experienced person is a valuable aid If several horses are studied 
they should be distinguished by name or number 

Record the color condition weight and height of the horse at the 
shoulder Height is given in hands a hand being the breadth of 
the palm or inches Note the slope of the shoulder of the back 
and the hips the general form of the head and neck and the facial 
expression Find the chestnuts warty growths on the inside of each 
leg Examine the foot finding the V shaped frog in the center 
surrounded by the horny hoof 

Find the pulse by passing the fingers downward from the upper curve 
of the neck along the inside of the jaw count the pulse Notice the 
position and motion of the ears with their lining of hair and the 
position of the eyes the form of the pupil and the probable range 
of vision Watch the horse use its lips and examine the mouth and 
teeth finding the grinding teeth far back in the mouth the incisors 
in front and the space where the canines are missing 

The male may have canines in the upper jaw 

On the surfaces of the incisors are the depressions or cups by 
means of which age is determined 

At six years the cups leave the lower center teeth at seven the 
adjoining teeth and at eight the outer lower teeth At nine 
years they leave the upper center incisors at ten the adjoining 
teeth and at eleven the outer teeth above At the age of ten 
years a spot appears in the outer upper incisors at fifteen 
years the groove has worn to the center of the tooth and at 
twenty-one years the groove is worn to the bottom of the tooth 


Questions

color markings weight and size Of what type and breed is it a 
specimen

variations in the form and number of the vertebra and the number of 
the ribs 


Questions 

In which types of vertebrates are the joints between the skull 
bones bound with cartilage How does the joining change in later 
types 

What dissimilarities occur in the series as regards closure or 
boxing in of the eye orbits nostrils and skull bones How would 
these changes in joining and closure affect strength rigidity and 
protection

capacity and intelligence 

State how the attachment of the skull to the vertebral column 
changes as the animal man assumes an erect position 

Are the vertebra of these types alike in structure What is the 
general form of a horizontally placed vertebra as in the horse or a 
reptile and of a vertically placed one as in man If you see any 
differences account for them 

Wherever possible find the vertebra of the neck cervical and 
note the number of them in each case 

How is flexibility of the column accomplished in certain types or 
in certain places of one type How is rigidity gained State 
instances in each answer

Definitions 

Spore a cell capable of developing into a new organism 

Asexual reproduction reproduction by division of the cell or body 

Sexual reproduction reproduction by means of the conjugation of 
two reproductive cells known as the egg and sperm cells 

Fertilization the fusion of the male or sperm cell with the egg or

different individuals 

Conscious the different kinds of reproductive organs found in the 
same individual 


Directions 

Note Refer to your notes if the animals mentioned in these 
exercises have been already studied This exercise may be largely 
review 

Study the methods of reproduction in the specimens or diagrams before 
you Determine first in what respects the methods of reproduction 
are similar in all second in what respects there is a variation 


Questions 

What has an am ba gained by dividing What powers has each new 
cell that the original am ba had lost What would have been the fate 
of the am ba if it had not divided into new cells 

What various forms of cell division did you find 

What is the simplest method of reproduction 


The Complex or Sexual Method of Reproduction 


Materials 

Slides or diagrams showing hydra and sponge reproducing sexually 
Conjugating paramecia fertilized and unfertilized starfish eggs

B DEVELOPMENT 


The Hen s Egg 


Materials 

Hen s eggs hydrophobic acid 


Definitions 

Germ spot a white spot embedded in the yolk This is the point 
at which development begins 

Yolk the yellow portion of a bird s egg This is a food material 
rich in fat 

Albumen the white viscous portion of a bird s egg 

Chaldea the spiral portion of albumen always seen in the bird s 
egg 


Directions 

Boil an egg at least ten minutes in water deep enough to cover it 
Note which side is uppermost and mark this part of the shell for 
reference Remove the egg and pick away the shell from about half the 
egg leaving the shell on that portion which was underneath when 
placed in water With a sharp knife remove this half of the egg Note 
the thickness of the shell Test its composition use hydrophobic 
acid Find the membrane lining the shell and note that at one end it 
separates into two parts to inclose an air space 

What is this for How does it change after an egg has been 
incubated for a week or more 

Break an uncooked egg in a saucer Note the germ spot Note also 
the difference in the consistency of the white albumen and 
yellow portion yolk 

Why does the latter retain its shape 

Why do the white and yolk not mix unless shaken or beaten 
together 

Look for the Chaldea 

What do you think is the use of this structure 

Weigh a fresh egg place it in a dry atmosphere for a week and 
weigh it again Record result Why may eggs be kept a long time 
perfectly fresh if coated with paraffin or if put in water 
glass

Blastula a hollow sphere the wall of which is composed of a 
single layer of cells 

Gastrula a stage formed from the blastula by pushing in one side 
of the latter to form a more or less cup shape structure 


Observations 

Is there any considerable difference between the size of the egg 
and the size of the blastula and gastrula Has development taken 
place by an increase of size or by an increase of complexity 

Contrast the blastula and gastrula as to number of cavities 
number of cell layers number of external openings 

Suggest protozoans that resemble the egg and blastula 
respectively What invertebrates resemble the gastrula in body plan

Development of the Chick 


Materials 

An incubator a brooder a setting of eggs 

Directions 

Read carefully the directions for setting up and regulating the 
incubator Remember that the temperature should average degrees 
and should not vary more than two or three degrees above or below 
this Candle the eggs from time to time and note difference in 
appearance as development proceeds especially as to transparency 
and size of the air space An egg that is transparent after ten days 
is probably infertile and should be removed Eggs which are 
developing properly will show from this time on a well-developed air 
space and will be quite opaque The veins often give a spider web 
appearance 

Twice each day remove the tray of eggs and allow cooling slightly 

Once a day the eggs should be turned before the tray is returned to 
the incubator 


Questions 

Describe the appearance of the shell when the chick is about to 
come out In about how many days after you put the eggs in the 
incubator did you first note this change You should watch the 
incubator carefully from the eighteenth day on

for the failure of some to hatch Did any which were pipped fail to 
hatch If so break them open and see if you can discover the 
trouble

CHAPTER VIII 

POULTRY 

Materials 

Either pictures or specimens of the different breeds of fowl 

General Information 

Under the term poultry are included chickens as well as turkeys 
pigeons ducks geese etc Chickens are most generally raised since 
they do not require such special conditions as the others In this 
exercise only this form of poultry is considered 

The hen has been domesticated from prehistoric times being probably 
derived from the so called jungle fowl of India Gallus bankiva 
which is still to be found in its native habitat Through constant 
attempts to improve the domestic fowl along the lines of greater 
egg production size etc there have been developed a great many breeds of fowl These may be divided into seven groups as 
follows 

The American Class 
The Asiatic Class 
The Mediterranean Class 
The English Class 
The Dutch Class 
The French Class 
The Ornamental and Exhibition Classes 

The American Class includes fowls raised both for egg production and 
for eating It includes the following well-known breeds the Plymouth 
Rocks the Wyandottes the Rhode Island Reds and the less known 
breeds of Javas Dominiques and Jersey Blues These all lay 
good sized brown eggs are good winter layers and stand confinement 
well The standard weight varies from six and one half pounds to 
seven and one half pounds for the hen and from eight and one half 
pounds to nine and one half pounds for the cock the Plymouth Rocks 
being the heaviest of the breeds 

There are three principal varieties of Plymouth Rocks the Barred 
Rocks with grayish white plumage regularly crossed with bars of 
blue-black the White Rocks and the Buff Rocks All have single 
upright combs which with the wattles and the ear lobes are bright 
red a large bright eye and yellow legs 

There are also three principal varieties of Wyandottes The 
Silver laced Wyandotte has a silvery white plumage with black 
markings in various parts of the body The Golden Wyandotte is 
similar in its markings but has yellow where the Silver laced has 
white The White Wyandotte is pure white All have rose combs red 
ear lobes and yellow legs They are on the average about a pound 
lighter than the Plymouth Rocks 
The Rhode Island Reds are a much more recent breed that has of late 
become very popular They are of a reddish brown color about the 
weight of the Wyandotte with yellow legs There are both single 
combed and rose combed varieties 

The Asiatic Class includes those breeds raised chiefly for the table 
The Brahmas Cochins and Langshans are the chief breeds They 
are considerably heavier than other breeds and are specially 
characterized by the feathers on the legs and feet They all lay 
brown eggs and are in many cases good layers 

The Brahmas include two principal varieties the light and the dark 
The general color is black and white and they have yellow legs red 
wattles ear lobes and comb the latter being of the kind called a 
pea comb which is of small size in the cock 

There are four varieties of Cochins the Buff being much more raised 
than the Partridge the White or the Black The Partridge somewhat 
resembles a dark Brahma but has red and brown plumage Cochins have 
single combs yellow legs and a general fluffy character to 
the plumage that of saddle and hackle meeting thus giving a 
characteristic appearance to these fowls The eggs are not quite so 
large as the other two breeds of this class 

The Langshans are smaller and more active than the two breeds just 
described They have black legs the feet are not so heavily 
feathered and in general these fowls are much less awkward in 
appearance There are two varieties the White and the Black 
The Mediterranean Class includes those breeds raised chiefly because 
of their great egg production They are active birds often 
troublesome because of their ability to fly over high enclosures so 
that when kept in the city it is usually necessary to clip one wing 
They are not so good winter layers as a rule but are non setters 
They all lay white eggs The chief breeds included are the Leghorns 
the Minors and the Black Spanish 
The Leghorns the most popular of these breeds include two chief 
varieties the Brown and the White The comb is most commonly single 
falling to one side in the hen the wattles long and pendulous the 
ear lobes white and the legs yellow 
The Minors are glossy black in color with a large drooping comb in 
the hen and long thin pendulous wattle They lay a very large egg 
The Black Spanish resemble the Minors but are distinguished by the 
white face and cheeks and the white on the inner edge of the wattles 
The English Class includes the Orpingtons and the Workings The 
Workings are one of the oldest breeds of fowl and sufficiently 
identified by the presence of a fifth toe There are three 
varieties the White the Silver gray and the Colored The White 
Dorking has a rose comb the Silver gray has a single comb and 
silvery gray plumage with black markings the hen having a 
salmon colored breast the Colored Workings have sometimes single and 
sometimes rose combs the plumage of the cock being black and 
straw colored and that of the hen being black and gray with the 
breast salmon marked with black 
The Orpingtons are short legged with close plumage They are of 
large size the hens being from seven to eight pounds and the cocks 
from nine to ten pounds There are three varieties the black the 
buff and the white The black except for shape might be mistaken 
for a Minor ca but has red ear lobes and black shanks The Orpingtons 
have the reputation of maturing early some strains being known to 
lay when four months old 

The Dutch Class includes the Red caps the Campines and the various 
varieties of the Hamburgs of which there are six the Golden 
Spangled the Silver Spangled the Golden Penciled the Silver 
Penciled the Black and the White They are all good layers and 
non setters but lay a small egg white They are readily 
recognized by their peculiar rose comb with its long spike like 
projection in the back their red face white ear lobes and bluish 
legs The prevailing color of the golden varieties is a reddish bay 
marked with black and of the silver varieties white marked with 
black The cock usually has more dark markings than the hen 

The Red caps are large fowl with a red and black plumage The comb is 
similar to the Hamburg s but larger and the ear lobes are red 

The Campines resemble the Hamburgs but have a single comb 

The French Class includes the Houdans the Crevec urs and the La 
Fleche The Houdans are mottled black and white with pinkish white 
legs with a fifth toe like the Workings and are easily recognized 
by their peculiar crest 

The other breeds of fowl like the crested Polish Bantams and game 
fowl have less interest in the poultry raiser though often seen in 
exhibitions and poultry shows 

To sum up we may group all these breeds according to their value 
into the egg breeds including the Leghorn Minor ca Spanish and 
Red cap the meat breeds including the Brahmas Cochins and 
Langshans the general purpose breeds including the Plymouth 
Rocks Wyandottes Rhode Island Reds Workings and Orpingtons and 
the fancy breeds including the Polish Bantams Games etc
